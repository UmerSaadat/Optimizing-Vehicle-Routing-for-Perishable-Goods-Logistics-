This report presents an in-depth analysis of the distribution management challenges faced by FreshRoutes Logistics, a Toronto-based company specializing in the delivery of fresh produce and groceries. The primary objective of this study was to optimize the company’s delivery routes using the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) model to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve customer satisfaction.
The project involved constructing a model based on a dataset of 20 customers, representing a subset of the company’s broader customer base. The model incorporated key parameters such as customer locations, time windows, vehicle capacities, and travel times. The Gurobi solver, integrated with Excel, was used to identify the optimal routes for a fleet of five homogeneous vehicles.
Key findings from the study indicate that the VRPTW model effectively automates and optimizes delivery operations, ensuring that all customers are served within their specified time windows while minimizing total delivery time. Although the model was simplified for this project, it successfully demonstrated the potential benefits of route optimization for FreshRoutes Logistics.
The report also explores various scenarios to assess the impact of changing parameters on the model’s performance. The insights gained from this analysis suggest that, while the current model meets the company’s needs, further enhancements could be made to address additional complexities, such as vehicle breakdowns or dynamic order cancellations.
In conclusion, the implementation of the VRPTW model has proven advantageous for FreshRoutes Logistics. Moving forward, the company could consider scaling the model to accommodate a heterogeneous fleet or expanding the scope to include multiple depots as the business grows.
